description: Published in 1838, this novel continues and completes the adventures
  begun in Homeward Bound , published earlier the same year. The novel begins with
  the much-delayed return of the Effingham family to Manhattan. Cooper satirizes his
  fellow countrymen, contrasting them unfavorably with the sophistication acquired
  by the Effinghams through their European associations.
